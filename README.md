# Sonar Sandbox
## Introduction
The Sonar Sandbox is tool used for demonstrating the principal operation of sonar. It was borne out a desire to create a beamformer demonstrator that can be used to educate school children and engineers alike. Upon its initial design, it became clear that it could be used for much more than just beamforming.

Here are some of the initial goals I had in mind:

- Propagation of sound (in air)
- Array Design - Pulse characteristics
- ADC Basics (& analogue signal conditioning) - Preamp, Anti-Alias Filter, Sampling Theory
- Temporal Filtering - Band-pass Filter
- Spatial Filtering - Time & Frequency Domain Beamforming
- Range Focusing

This repository will contain all project assets including but not limited to hardware options and designs, software implementation.
